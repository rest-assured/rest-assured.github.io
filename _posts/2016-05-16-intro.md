Testing and validating REST services in Java is harder than in dynamic languages such as Ruby and Groovy. REST Assured brings the simplicity of using these 
languages into the Java domain. For example if your HTTP server returns the following [JSON](http://www.json.org/) at "http://localhost:8080/lotto/{id}":
 
```json
{
   "lotto":{
      "lottoId":5,
      "winning-numbers":[2,45,34,23,7,5,3],
      "winners":[
         {
            "winnerId":23,
            "numbers":[2,45,34,23,3,5]
         },
         {
            "winnerId":54,
            "numbers":[52,3,12,11,18,22]
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

You can easily use REST Assured to validate interesting things from the response:

```java
@Test public void
lotto_resource_returns_200_with_expected_id_and_winners() {
    
    when().
            get("/lotto/{id}", 5).
    then().
            statusCode(200).
            body("lotto.lottoId", equalTo(5), 
                 "lotto.winners.winnerId", containsOnly(23, 54));

}
```

Looks easy enough? Why not give it a spin? See [getting started](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/GettingStarted) and [usage guide](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage).
